# Hardness of Approximation for 2 → 4 Norms through Quantum Reductions

We study the computational complexity of approximating 2 → 4 linear operator norm, defined as `∥A∥2→4 = max{f != 0} ( ∥Af∥_4 / ∥f∥_2 )` We explore the problem of multiplicatively approximating such a norm to a constant factor. We present the previous results in the area, share our attempt to give a new NP-hardness proof, and discuss applications to other problems, such as Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture.
